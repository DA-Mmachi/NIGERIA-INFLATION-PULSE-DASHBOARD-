# Nigeria's Inflation Pulse (2010–2024): Tracking Oil Prices, Exchange Rates & Policy Impact

## Project Overview
---
#### This project presents a data-driven dashboard that analyzes Nigeria’s inflation trends from 2010 to 2024, highlighting the impact of macroeconomic variables such as: Exchange Rate (₦/$), Oil Price ($/BBL), Monetary Policy Rate (MPR %), GDP Growth Rate (%).It provides a comprehensive view of how macroeconomic policies, global oil shocks, and structural reforms have influenced inflation over the years.Amid rising inflation and economic reforms, this dashboard was built to answer a critical policy and economic question

## Data Sources

The data for this project was sourced from credible, publicly available platforms:

- Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) -Monetary Policy Rate (MPR), FX Rates

- National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) -Inflation and GDP Data

- World Bank Open Data -Brent Crude Oil Prices (Annual Avg.)

- Period: 2010 to 2024

  ## Data Tools

1. Microsoft Excel - Dashboard creation, data visualization, slicer interactivity
  
2. Pivot Tables - Metric aggregation and summary computation
  
3. Excel Charts - Line charts, combo charts, scatter plots for trend correlation
  
4. R² Coefficient - Measuring the strength of correlation between variables

## Data Cleaning / Preperation

- Cleaned and standardized raw data using Microsoft Excel to ensure consistency and accuracy for analysis.
  
- Merged datasets from multiple sources (NBS, CBN, World Bank)

- Transformed data into consistent yearly formats

- Currency exchange rates normalized to ₦/$

- Created a unified base table for analysis

  ## Exploratory Data Analysis

- How did inflation behave during oil price crashes and reforms?

- What is the relationship between ₦/$ exchange rate and inflation over time?

- Did higher MPR control inflation effectively?

- How strong is the correlation between oil prices and inflation?

- Which macro variables showed the strongest predictive trend?

  ## Data Analysis Approach

Here’s how I analyzed the relationships:

- Trend Analysis: Line graphs and combo charts show inflation over time and its movement against other variables.

- Correlation Analysis: Used R² (coefficient of determination) to measure strength of relationships in scatter plots.

- Inflation vs Oil Price across three periods:

   - Pre-shock (2010–2014)

   - Oil Crash & COVID (2015–2020)

   - Reform Years (2021–2024)

- Economic Storytelling: Added annotations to describe trends and insights clearly.

- Slicers: Included for year-by-year comparison.

## Results / Findings

- Inflation vs Exchange Rate: ₦ devaluation triggered inflation spikes, especially post-2023 FX reform. Strong pass-through effect observed.

- Inflation vs MPR: Despite rising interest rates, inflation kept increasing → suggests cost-push inflation.

- Inflation vs Oil Price: Weak correlation during 2015–2020 (R² = 0.13), stronger post-2021 (R² = 0.71) due to subsidy reform and fuel price hike.

- Inflation Trend: Inflation remained moderate before 2015, spiked in 2016, and sharply increased from 2022 to 2024.

  ## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations emerge:

- Improve FX stability: Inflation closely follows naira depreciation. Managing FX volatility is crucial to inflation control.

- Diversify inflation control strategy: MPR alone is ineffective. Address supply-side and structural inflation factors.

- Policy timing matters: Sudden reforms (e.g., subsidy removal) can trigger inflation spikes if not phased properly.

- Data transparency: Continue improving access to real-time macroeconomic data to support decision-making.
